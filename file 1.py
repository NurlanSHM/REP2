# Here i used AI for it to explain to me how i could optimize the code more, surprised i got quite close to the optimized one. 
# NOTE: This is NOT AI, but is optimized by AI, which didnt change much. I created these files to test and improve my Python knowledge outside of YT Courses
# Note again that I am currently 14 yo at the time of creation of this file. Having foreshadowed this will be shown to a university/in a job application.
# If this did get to a university/job, this me would be very happy and grateful for creating this, especially posting it on GitHub. As expanding is
# the only reason im doing this. Thank you.
